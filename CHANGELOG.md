## Fips Changelog

- **16-May-2022**: fips will now always call ```cmake --build``` instead of
  invoking the build tools ```make```, ```ninja``` or ```xcodebuild``` directly.
  This should "just work" and not require any changes on your project.

- **15-May-2022**: a python2 vs python3 compatibility fix to workaround the deprecated
  distutils.spawn.find_executable() function

- **11-Jan-2022**: A new setting ```local=[on|off]``` (default: off). If this
  is on, the build- and deploy-directories will be moved into the project
  directory under ```fips-files/build``` and ```fips-files/deploy```. External
  dependencies still live directly under the workspace directory, but
  eventually it would make sense to move under ```fips-files/deps``` as well.
  Currently this change is mainly useful for CI/CD services which don't allow
  to access build output outside the project directory. To activate this
  'local-build-mode' run ```./fips set local on``` in the project directory. To deactivate,
  either run ```./fips set local off``` or ```./fips unset local```.

- **26-Feb-2021**: The Android default platform API level has been bumped from
  21 to 28 (Android 9 Pie).  Please also re-install the Android SDK/NDK by
  deleting fips-sdk/android and then ```./fips setup android```

- **03-Jun-2020**:
  - The embedded precompiled ninja.exe for Windows has been removed. Please use
    a package manager like scoop.sh to install ninja instead.
  - A new meta-build-tool 'vscode_ninja' which directly invokes ninja instead
    of 'cmake --build' when building from inside VSCode.
  - Some cleanup in the code dealing with the 'build_tool' build config attribute.

- **30-May-2020**: I have removed to -Wno-unused-parameter option from the
GCC and Clang build configs. In hindsight it wasn't a good idea to suppress
this warning globally.

- **11-Jan-2020**: I have created the [fips-utils](https://github.com/fips-libs/fips-utils)
respository and started to move some 'non-core' verbs from the fips core repository
there. Currently these are: *markdeep, gdb and valgrind*

- **24-Oct-2019**: the verbs ```fips build``` and ```fips make``` can now forward
command line arguments to the underlying build tool, run ```fips help build```
and ```fips help make``` for details.

- **20-Jul-2019**: Starting with cmake 3.15, cmake will issue a warning if the
top-level CMakeLists.txt file doesn't contain a verbatim call to ```project()```
near the top, suppress this warning by changing the ```fips_setup(PROJECT proj_name)```
statement to:
    ```cmake
    project(proj_name)
    fips_setup()
    ```

- **02-Jul-2019**: small quality-of-life improvement when using Visual Studio:
  the debugger working directory for VS targets is now set to the project's
  deploy-directory (```fips-deploy/[project]/[config]```), so that debugging
  behaves the same as running a target via ```fips run [target]```

- **30-Jun-2019**: ```./fips run [target]``` for emscripten targets is now
  using npm's http-server module, since this is more feature-complete than
  python's built-in SimpleHTTPServer. Install with ```npm install http-server -g```
  and check if fips can find it with ```./fips diag tools```

- **31-May-2019**: The emscripten SDK integration has been completely rewritten:
    - adds a new fips verb 'emsdk' for installing specific emscripten SDK versions and switching between them
    - by default, installs the latest stable emscripten SDK with precompiled
      binaries, this is a lot faster than installing the 'incoming' SDK
      version which needs to compile LLVM
    - the emscripten cmake toolchain file is no longer hardwired to a specific
      emscripten SDK version
    - the default options in the emscripten cmake toolchain file have been
      updated to make more sense with current emscripten SDK versions
      (such as enabled WASM generation by default, reducing the initial
      heap size, and enabling memory growth)

  **AFTER UPDATING** the fips directory, run the following in your project
  to switch over:
    ```bash
    # remove all cached emscripten build files
    > ./fips clean all
    # remove any old emscripten SDK files
    > ./fips emsdk uninstall
    # install and activate new emscripten SDK
    > ./fips emsdk install
    # show help to get an idea of emsdk features
    > ./fips help emsdk
    ```
    As before, each fips workspace directory has its own local emscripten SDK installation, you can use
    different SDK versions side-by-side in different workspaces and fips won't 'pollute' your global environment or interfere with a globally installed
    emscripten SDK.
    The command ```./fips setup emscripten``` works as before and is an alias for ```./fips emsdk install```

- **08-May-2019**: Some tweaks to the release-mode compiler- and linker-flags
    for Visual Studio projects: in release mode, link-time code-generation
    (aka LTO) is now always enabled. If this causes any trouble for your
    projects, please open a github ticket, and I'll add something to make
    this optional :)

- **20-Jan-2019**:
    - NaCl and UWP support have been removed (both haven't been maintained for a very long time)
    - remove the builtin unittest support, this was hardwired to UnitTest++ and should
      better be done in project-specific scripts (see Oryol for an example)

- **03-Jul-2018**: on iOS and MacOS, you can now simply add a *.plist file
to the file list of a target, and this will override the default plist file
generated by fips. For instance:
    ```cmake
    fips_begin_app(...)
        ...
        if (FIPS_IOS)
            fips_files(ios-info.plist)
        end()
        ...
    fips_end_app()
    ```
- **12-Apr-2018**: there are now new optional locations for fips-directories
and -files in a project in order to unclutter the project directory root a
bit (all under a new project subdirectory called ```fips-files/```):
    - ```fips-verbs/``` => ```fips-files/verbs/```
    - ```fips-configs/``` => ```fips-files/configs/```
    - ```fips-generators/``` => ```fips-files/generators/```
    - ```fips-toolchains/``` => ```fips-files/toolchains```
    - ```fips-include.cmake``` => ```fips-files/include.cmake```

- **10-Mar-2018**: some Visual Studio Code improvements:
    - the .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json file is now written to all dependent
      projects, this fixes Intellisense problems in dependencies
    - new verb **fips vscode clean** for deleting the .vscode/ directories
      in all dependencies, this is useful before git operations (e.g. _fips update_)
      if you don't want/can add the .vscode directory to your .gitignore file
    - .vscode/tasks.json and .vscode/launch.json files in dependencies will be deleted during _fips gen_ if generating a VSCode build config, otherwise VSCode would also show build tasks and debug targets from dependencies, which is cluttering the build/debug workflow UIs
    - it is now possible to add additional compiler defines just for the VSCode Intellisense engine in custom build config files, this is for instance useful with header-only libraries to 'light up' syntax highlighting in the implementation code block, example:
    ```yaml
    ---
    platform: osx
    generator: Ninja
    build_tool: vscode_cmake
    build_type: Debug
    vscode_additional_defines: [ 'CHIPS_IMPL', 'SOKOL_IMPL' ]
    ```
- **01-Feb-2018**: iOS development is now a bit more convenient: fips can
write the "Development Team ID" to the generated Xcode project (previously,
the Team ID had to be set manually for each target in Xcode). Before calling
```./fips gen``` for the first time in a project, set the Team ID via
```./fips set iosteam XYZW123456```, where XYZW123456 must be replaced with
your own Team ID, you can look this up on
https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership). The Team ID will be
written to the file _[cur\_proj\_dir]/.fips-settings.yml_ (which usually
isn't under version control). You can review the currently set Team ID with
```./fips list settings```. Here's a usage example:

```bash
> ./fips set config ios-xcode-debug
# only need to set the Team ID once!
> ./fips set iosteam XYZW123456
> ./fips gen
> ./fips open
...
> ./fips gen
...
```

- **30-Jan-2018**: Android support has been modernized, usage should
be the same as before, but there are some nice changes under the hood:
  - ```fips setup android``` now only downloads the SDK Tools archive,
  and uses the contained ```sdkmanager``` tool to install the required
  SDK components (including the NDK)
  - fips is now using the official Android NDK cmake toolchain file
  - Android builds no longer require the ```ant``` tool, and also
  don't need Gradle or Android Studio to build projects, instead
  APKs are created directly by a small python helper script
  called from a cmake post-build job, as a result, Android builds
  are now also quite a bit faster
  - you can now use Android Studio for debugging (tested so far on
  Mac and Windows), select the ```Profile or debug APK``` option when
  starting Android Studio, and follow the steps (sometimes debugging
  still seems to hang or ignore breakpoints on first start, in this
  case, just stop debugging and try again)
  - some things are not yet configurable:
    - override the default AndroidManifest.xml
    - sign APKs with your own key
    - add your own Java code to the APK
    - add your own assets to the APK

- **16-Jan-2018**: The iOS build configs now put the resulting .app bundle
into the ```fips-deploy/[proj]/[config]/``` directory, so they behave
the same as most other target platforms. This makes it
easier for helper scripts (code generators and verbs) to
find the iOS app bundle (for instance to copy asset files).

- **05-Jan-2018**: Import definitions in fips.yml files can now contain an
expression which is evaluated in cmake. This can be used to include or
exclude platform-specific includes. [See here for details](http://floooh.github.io/fips/docs/imports/)

- **04-Jan-2018**: The previously experimental Visual Studio Code support is
now 'official', [see here for details](http://floooh.github.io/2018/01/04/vscode-fips.html)

- **16-Aug-2017**: I found (and fixed) some inconsistent behaviour when
the cmake project name is different from the project's directory name,
this may change the behaviour of cmake- and python-code-generator
scripts which used the FIPS\_PROJECT\_DEPLOY\_DIR and
FIPS\_PROJECT\_BUILD\_DIR (but the previous behaviour was clearly a bug,
which only manifested itself if the cmake project name and directory
name differed). See this ticket for details: https://github.com/floooh/fips/issues/154

- **25-Apr-2017**: I committed a small fix which changes the order of
imported dependencies so that imported dependencies now always come
before the importing project. This was often also the case previously
but could fail in cases where the same dependency was included from
different projects. No changes should be required in your project,
at least if the dependency tree was defined correctly and didn't
depend on some hidden ordering.

- **27-Mar-2017**: the root path of the emscripten SDK has changed from
emsdk\_portable to emsdk-portable, a fix has been committed, but you
need to setup the emscripten SDK again (first, wipe the fips-sdks directory,
then run './fips setup emscripten' again from a project directory)

- **25-Feb-2017**: what happened in the last year:
  - python3 compatibility contributed by Levente Polyak (thanks!)
  - various Eclipse fixes contributed by Martin Gerhardy (thanks!)
  - Windows: Cygwin support contributed by Fungos, many thanks! also
    for the many smaller fixes :)
  - new verb './fips update' updates all dependencies (unless
    they have uncommitted or unpushed changes)
  - new helper functions git.add, git.commit and git.push,
    these are not exposed as fips verbs, but are useful
    for writing your own verbs (e.g. build automation scripts)
  - emscripten: removed the FIPS\_EMSCRIPTEN\_EXPORTED\_FUNCTIONS
    cmake options, this is better done by directly annotating
    exported functions with EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE (or soon
    [EMSCRIPTEN_EXPORT](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/pull/4977))
  - a new predefined cmake variable FIPS\_BUILD\_DIR, this points
    to the build root directory (../fips\_build)
  - two new predefined cmake variables FIPS\_PROJECT\_BUILD\_DIR
    and FIPS\_PROJECT\_DEPLOY\_DIR, these are useful to pass
    as arguments to code generator scripts
  - emscripten: use linker response files when using the UNIX
    Makefiles generator to workaround command line length limit
    on Windows
  - emscripten: on Windows, use the Emscripten SDK incoming
    branch (requires LLVM compilation, but behaviour is now the
    same as on OSX and Linux)
  - fips\_files\_ex() and related cmake functions now warn if
    the globbed file list is empty, previously this generated
    a rather cryptic cmake syntax error message
  - emscripten: added support for WebAssembly (toolchain flags
    and build configs)
  - emscripten: added a config option FIPS\_EMSCRIPTEN\_USE\_WEBGL2
  - emscripten: added new cmake options
    FIPS\_EMSCRIPTEN\_USE\_CPU\_PROFILER and
    FIPS\_EMSCRIPTEN\_USE\_MEMORY\_PROFILER (these generate a build
    with emscripten's built-in cpu and memory profilers)
  - emscripten: added a FIPS\_EMSCRIPTEN\_USE\_SAFE\_HEAP cmake option
  - emscripten: use the smaller 'shell\_minimal.html' file instead
    of the original file which has a big SVG logo in it
  - emscripten: use the -s NO\_EXIT\_RUNTIME which slightly
    reduces code size
  - Windows UWP support (not in daily use though)

- **26-Feb-2016**: cmake generator definition in fips build config files
is now more flexible by exposing the cmake -A (generator platform)
and -T options (generator toolset), there's now also a 'Default' generator
which lets cmake select the 'best' build file generator for the platform. All this
together simplifies the version situation with Visual Studio on Windows.
Previously, the build config win64-vs2013-debug was used as default config.
When only VS2015 is installed, generating build files had failed, unless
the build config win64-vs2015-debug was selected manually. Now there's
a new generic default config called **win64-vstudio-debug**. This lets
cmake pick whatever VStudio version is installed. Of course it is still
possible to pick a specific Visual Studio version with the 'old' build
configs \*-vs2013-\* and \*-vs2015-\*.

- **14-Feb-2016**: fips can now import dependencies pinned to a specific git
  revision (previously only by tag or branch name). Many thanks to fungos
  (https://github.com/fungos) for implementing this! Here's how a specific
  revision is specified in the fips.yml file:
```
  imports:
    fips-hello-dep3:
      git:    https://github.com/fungos/fips-hello-dep3.git
      rev:    191f59f0
```
- **03-Dec-2015**: I have added a new 'no\_auto\_import' policy/feature for
  advanced uses which allows to manually select modules from imported
  projects. This is more work but can provide a cleaner project layout
  if only a few modules from imported projects are needed. See the
  documentation web page for details (http://floooh.github.io/fips/docs/imports/,
  search for 'Selectively importing modules'). The default behaviour should
  be exactly as before. If anything is broken in your project, please
  don't hesitate to write a ticket :)

- **13-Oct-2015**: 'fips run' has learned to run Android apps, after building
  your project with one of the Android build configs, simply do a
  'fips run [target]' like on the other platforms. This will (re-)install
  the app, launch it, and then run 'adb logcat' (simply hit Ctrl-C when done)

- **10-Oct-2015**: I committed a simplification for nested dependency
  resolution yesterday (turns out cmake does this on its own with
  'target_link_libraries'), however this may introduce some link-order problems
  in existing projects when using GCC or emscripten. If your project no longer
  links because of this, and you think that fixing the depedency order in the
  CMakeLists.txt files is too big a hassle and fips should take care of this,
  please simply open a ticket, and I'll try to find a solution in fips. I
  haven't made up my mind about this either yet, the few cases in Oryol were
  easy to fix, but larger projects may be more tricky to fix.

- **29-Jul-2015**: cross-compiling is now more flexible
    * cross-compile target platform names are no longer hardwired, fips
      projects can now add define their own cross-compile platforms
    * fips projects can now provide their own cmake-toolchain files or override
      the standard toolchain files

- **05-Feb-2015**: the NaCl SDK setup bug has been fixed by the NaCl team, so
  './fips setup nacl' should now work also with the latest Python 2.7.9

- **01-Feb-2015**: the code generation refactoring branch has been merged back
  into the master branch, code generation is now controlled with the new
  **fips_generate()** cmake macro, see [Oryol
  engine](https://github.com/floooh/oryol) and [code generation doc
  page](http://floooh.github.io/fips/docs/codegen/) for details!

- **30-Jan-2015**: please note that the NaCl SDK setup script is currently
  broken with Python 2.7.9 (2.7.6 works), this is tracked in the following bug:
  https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=452137
