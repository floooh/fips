# Directory Structure

fips creates project directories and a few special directories on the same
level as the fips directory itself.

```
┣━━ fips/
┣━━ fips-build/
┣━━ fips-deploy/
┣━━ fips-sdks/
┣━━ project-1/
┣━━ project-2/
┣━━ .../
```

### The fips-build directory

The **fips-build** directory contains the generated cmake build files, 
separated in subdirectories by project name and config name. The
content of fips-build is created with the _'fips gen'_ command (or on the 
fly during _'fips build'_ or _'fips make'_):

```
┗━━ fips-build/
    ┣━━ project-1/
    ┃   ┣━━ osx-xcode-debug/
    ┃   ┃   ┣━━ oryol.xcodeproj/
    ┃   ┃   ┗━━ ...
    ┃   ┗━━ emsc-make-release/
    ┃       ┣━━ Makefile
    ┃       ┗━━ ...
    ┗━━ project-2/
        ┗━━ emsc-make-release/
            ┣━━ Makefile
            ┗━━ ...
```

### The fips-deploy directory

The **fips-deploy** directory contains the built executable files, also 
separated in subdirectories by project and config name. The content of the
fips-deploy directory is created during the _'fips build'_ or _'fips make'_
commands:

```
┗━━ fips-deploy/
    ┣━━ project-1/
    ┃   ┣━━ osx-xcode-debug/
    ┃   ┃   ┣━━ app-1.app
    ┃   ┃   ┣━━ app-2.app
    ┃   ┃   ┗━━ ...
    ┃   ┗━━ emsc-make-release/
    ┃       ┣━━ app-1.html
    ┃       ┣━━ app-2.html
    ┃       ┗━━ ...
    ┗━━ project-2/
        ┗━━ emsc-make-release/
            ┣━━ app-1.html
            ┗━━ ...
```

Both the fips-build and fips-deploy directories contain only generated files,
it is not dangerous to completely delete these directories.

The fips command _'fips clean [config]'_ deletes the generated files for all
configs, the active config, or a named config.

### The fips-sdks directory

The fips-sdks directory contains the platform SDK files installed with:

```
> fips setup emscripten
> fips setup android
```

The fips-sdks directory structure currently looks like this (details
may change in the future):

```
┗━━ fips-sdks/
    ┗━━ android
    ┗━━ emsdk
```

### Special fips files

A project needs at least a **fips.yml** file to be recognized as a fips project.
Most projects have additional fips-specific files and directories:

```
┗━━ project-1/
    ┣━━ fips.yml 
    ┣━━ fips 
    ┣━━ fips.cmd 
    ┣━━ fips-files/
    ┃   ┣━━ include.cmake 
    ┃   ┣━━ verbs/ 
    ┃   ┣━━ generators/ 
    ┃   ┣━━ configs/
    ┃   ┗━━ toolchains/
    ┣━━ .fips-settings.yml
    ┣━━ .fips-imports.cmake
    ┗━━ .fips-gen.py
```

All files except _fips.yml_ are optional, all hidden files 
(starting with a '.') are maintained by fips and should not be under version
control.

Here's a description of what each file means:

- **fips.yml**: contains the imports, exports and policy options of the project
- **fips**: proxy python script to be able to run fips commands from within
the project directory
- **fips.cmd**: Windows batch file to call the _'fips'_ python script
- **fips-files/include.cmake**: if present, this cmake file is included by other fips 
projects which depend on this project, this can be used to define global 
cmake attributes for projects which export multiple modules
- **fips-files/verbs/**: if present, this directory contains python scripts which
add additional commands (verbs) to fips
- **fips-files/generators/**: if present, this directory contains python code-generator
scripts which are called during the build process
- **fips-files/configs/**: if present, the fips-files/configs directory contains additional
fips configs, the config names must not collide with the fips standard config
names (e.g. osx-xcode-debug), so it is a good idea to include the project name
in those custom configs
- **fips-files/toolchains**: if this directory exists it should contain cmake toolchain
files, which can either override the standard toolchain files in the fips-directory,
or can be completely new toolchain files for new platforms. Toolchain files
can be defined in build-configs using the 'cmake-toolchain' attribute. 
Toolchain files will be searched in the following order: first in the current
project, then in imported projects, and finally in the fips directory itself.
- **.fips-settings.yml**: hidden file with project-specific fips settings 
generated by _'fips set [key] [value]'_ or _'fips unset [key]'_
- **.fips-imports.cmake**: generated cmake file which contains all imports of
the project, the .fips-imports.cmake file is created during _'fips gen'_ and
other fips commands which implicitly do a cmake run (like _'fips build'_ or
_'fips make'_)
- **.fips-gen.py**: a generated python helper script for code generation during
the build process
